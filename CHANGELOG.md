# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

The versions coincide with releases on pip. Only major versions will be released as tags on Github.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/singularityhub/guts/tree/main) (0.0.x)
 - adding diff and fs (filesystem) extraction support (0.0.13)
 - tag should be own file (0.0.12)
 - Support for output directory (so path prepared by guts) (0.0.11)
 - Initial creation of project (0.0.1)
